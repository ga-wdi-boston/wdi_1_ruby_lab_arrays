# Lab 1: Days of our Lives

Don't forget to use Pry to check the results of your code!

1. In a new Ruby file, create an array (and assign it to a variable) containing the days of the week as strings, with Monday as the first and Sunday as the last.
<!-- Done -->

2. My calendar says Sunday is the first day of the week. Write code to move Sunday from the end of the array to the beginning.
<!-- Done -->

3. I'm really excited about Thursday for some reason. Write code to find that day in the array and make it all uppercase.
<!-- Done -->

4. Create and assign a new array which contains two sub-arrays: One containing all the weekdays, and one containing the weekends.
<!-- Done -->

5. Let's get in touch with our Viking heritage. With your new array of arrays, write code that will change Wednesday to "Woden's Day".
<!-- Done -->

6. On second thought, I don't like weekdays at all. Write code that deletes the weekdays from the array of arrays, leaving only the weekend days.
<!-- Done -->

7. Going back to your original array of days, write code that sorts the days alphabetically and assigns these to a new variable.
<!-- Done -->

8. Finally, print out (on the terminal) the list of sorted days, with each day on its own line.
<!-- Done -->
